Hangman is a guessing game.

A word is chosen at random, and the player must guess letters of the word.

If the player guesses a letter that is in the word, the letter is revealed.

If the player guesses a letter that is not in the word, a part of the hangman is drawn.

The player has 10 guesses to correctly guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
